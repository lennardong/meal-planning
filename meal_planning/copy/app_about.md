## Why This Planner?

Modern diets have drifted far from the diversity our gut microbiome evolved to expect. We eat the same handful of dishes on rotation, missing out on the **variety of fibers, polyphenols, and nutrients** that feed a thriving gut ecosystem.

This planner helps you break that pattern.

### How It Works

1. **Build your catalogue** — Add dishes you enjoy cooking, spanning different cuisines and categories
2. **Create a shortlist** — Select dishes you want to include this month
3. **Generate a plan** — Get a balanced 4-week rotation that maximizes variety

### The Science

Research suggests that eating **30+ different plant foods per week** supports gut microbiome diversity. This planner helps you get there by:

- Balancing **Eastern and Western cuisines** for broader ingredient variety
- Rotating through different **cooking categories** (fermented, raw, slow-cooked, etc.)
- Tracking your **diversity score** so you can see improvement over time

> *"The gut microbiome is like a garden — it thrives on variety, not monoculture."*

### Getting Started

Browse the catalogue on the left, add dishes to your shortlist on the right, then hit **Generate Plan** to see your personalized meal rotation with diversity analysis.

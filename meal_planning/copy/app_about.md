# Why Palate?

Most people eat the same 12 foods on repeat. Even the healthy ones.

Your gut didn't evolve on overnight oats and sad desk salads. It evolved on **variety**—dozens of different plants, fermented foods, seeds, grains, across seasons and cuisines.

Palate helps you break the rotation.

## How It Works

1. **Build Your Palette** — Add dishes you cook, across cuisines and categories
2. **Pick Your Week** — Select what you want to eat this month
3. **See Your Colors** — Get a plan that maximizes variety, with your diversity score

## The Science

Research shows that eating **30+ different plant foods per week** dramatically improves gut microbiome diversity. Palate helps you get there by:

- Balancing **Eastern and Western cuisines** for broader ingredient range
- Rotating through **cooking categories** (fermented, raw, slow-cooked, etc.)
- Tracking your **Palate Score** so you can see improvement over time

> "The gut microbiome is like a garden—it thrives on variety, not monoculture."

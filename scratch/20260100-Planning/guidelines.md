## 🚫 AVOID (Eliminate or Drastically Reduce)

These are actively harming your gut profile:

| Food | Why It's Bad For YOU | Replace With |
|------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Marmite / Vegemite** | Extreme histamine (500-2000 mg/kg). Daily use is your biggest issue. | Tahini, hummus, nut butter |
| **Cream cheese** | Histamine + feeds Collinsella (your inflammatory bacteria) | Avocado, cashew cream, hummus |
| **Aged cheeses** (cheddar, parmesan, blue) | High histamine, aged = more histamine | Fresh cheeses only (paneer, fresh mozz, ricotta) |
| **Vinegar** (balsamic, wine, apple cider) | Histamine trigger, fermentation byproduct | Lemon juice, lime juice |
| **Soy sauce** | Fermented = high histamine | Coconut aminos, or small amount tamari |
| **Alcohol** | Histamine + kills beneficial bacteria + feeds Klebsiella | Kombucha (low sugar), sparkling water |
| **Canned fish** (tuna, sardines, anchovies) | Extreme histamine accumulation | Fresh fish only, eaten same day |
| **Processed veggie meats** | Histamine + additives + often contain yeast extract | Whole food proteins (tempeh, tofu, legumes) |
| **Leftover food stored >24h in fridge** | Histamine doubles every 24h at fridge temp | Freeze immediately, thaw fresh |

## ⚠️ REDUCE (Limit to 1-2x/Week Max)

Not terrible, but problematic if frequent:

| Food | Current Problem | Limit To |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **White/refined bread** | Feeds Bacteroides, not Prevotella. Low fiber. | 1-2x/week max |
| **Kefir** | Mixed bag - good bacteria but some histamine strains | 3-4x/week, not daily |
| **Yogurt** | Same as kefir - some strains produce histamine | Alternate with non-dairy options |
| **Tomatoes** (cooked/canned) | Moderate histamine, worse when cooked | Fresh only, limit canned/paste |
| **Spinach** | Higher histamine than other greens | Rotate with kale, bok choy, etc. |
| **Eggplant** | Histamine liberator | Occasional, not staple |
| **Mushrooms** | Can be high histamine depending on freshness | Only very fresh, limit quantity |
| **Citrus fruits** | Histamine liberators (don't contain histamine but trigger release) | Small amounts, not daily |
| **Nuts (walnuts, cashews)** | Can accumulate histamine if not fresh | Buy small quantities, refrigerate |
| **Chocolate/cocoa** | Histamine liberator | Small amounts dark chocolate, not daily |
